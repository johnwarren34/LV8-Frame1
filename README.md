LV8 Framework
Revolutionizing AI with Decentralized Intelligence

LV8 Framework is an open-source platform for building modular, scalable, and decentralized AI systems. It is designed for developers to create autonomous agents with capabilities such as task delegation, multi-modal processing, swarm intelligence, and blockchain integration.

This project is not just a framework; it is a showcase of collaborative innovation between human creators and AI agents. Every component of this repository has been conceptualized, designed, and refined through the synergy of human oversight and machine intelligence.

Key Features

Modular AI Agents

Agents capable of multi-modal task execution (text, image, audio).
Autonomous decision-making through reinforcement learning.
Collaboration and task delegation using a swarm-based framework.
Blockchain Integration

Solana: Native wallet creation, transactions, and smart contract interaction.
Ethereum: Balance retrieval, token transfers, and decentralized logging.
Decentralized Data

IPFS Integration: Decentralized file storage and retrieval for transparent and resilient systems.
Swarm Intelligence

Collaborative decision-making using Redis-backed proposals and voting.

Core Components

AI Agent: Modular and autonomous agents for decentralized systems.
Knowledge Graph: Store, query, and visualize relationships between concepts.
Swarm Consensus: Dynamic task delegation and voting using Redis and Lua.
Blockchain Manager: Interact with Solana and Ethereum networks.
IPFS Utility: Decentralized file handling.
Basic Model for Complex Tasks

This framework is intended as a basic model to demonstrate how advanced concepts like blockchain, IPFS, swarm intelligence, and reinforcement learning can be combined into a single system.

While it integrates multiple state-of-the-art technologies, it is not intended to represent a fully production-ready solution but rather serve as a starting point for further development.

By providing this framework, we aim to inspire and empower developers to explore these technologies in a practical way without the overwhelming complexity often associated with combining them. Use it, extend it, and adapt it to your needs.

Built with AI

The LV8 Framework represents a collaborative effort between human creativity and AI-driven agents. Every line of code has been guided and enhanced by AI, making this repository a testament to the power of human-AI synergy.
